    <td>To have coded our first basic sprites on Space Invaders.</td>

    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>Yes, I kept up with the code instructions and have made a good start to my project.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I found it hard to remember all the code so I had to think about what would come next in my code.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I had to ask my Mum to give me instructions on how to import new sprites into my game.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I had to work on my own to figure out how the code worked when we had to code our bullet.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What could I have done better?</td>
    <td>I could have worked out the way to code the bullet quicker and maybe experimented more before I asked for help with my homework.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td>I need to improve my problem solving by using methods I have learnt previously like saving the image into a file then importing it from the file into the game.</td>
